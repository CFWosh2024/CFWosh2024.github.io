# CF24-OSHW
## Workshop on Open-Source Hardware 

***Co-located with 21th ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers (CF' 24)***
***May 7 - May 9, 2023 - Ischia (NA), Italy***

We are excited to announce a new workshop on the topic of open-source hardware, to be held concurrently with Computing Frontiers 2024.

#### Aim and Scope

The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working in the fields of computer architecture, electrical engineering, and computer science to discuss and share their latest research and developments in open-source hardware and related open-source software. We welcome submissions on a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Design/implementation based on open-source processors, memory systems, and I/O devices
- CAD tools and methodologies for hardware design based on open-source
- Embedded systems and IoT devices based on open-source
- PCB, FPGA, and ASIC design and fabrication based on open-source
- Firmware and software for embedded systems based on open-source
- Compilers and frameworks based on open-source
- Test and Verification frameworks for hardware based on open-source
- Power and Energy-Efficient systems based on open-source
- Hardware security and trust in open-source systems

Submissions should be in the form of an **extended abstract (minimum 2, maximum 4 pages)**, formatted according to the double-column ACM conference format, accompanied by a link to a public repository (GitHub, etc.). Accepted abstracts will be included in the workshop proceedings and published in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of an accepted abstract is required to register for the whole Computing Frontiers 2024 conference.
